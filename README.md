# Canberra Pickers & Fiddlers tune book
A project to create an interactive PDF document of sheet music for the Canberra Pickers &amp; Fiddlers old time music session. 

Tunes are created in ABC notation (https://abcnotation.com/)

The static HTML site is based on the [https://neat-starter.netlify.app/](https://neat-starter.netlify.app/) by Surjith S M ( [@surjithctly](https://surjithctly.in/) )

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
