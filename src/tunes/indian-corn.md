  T:Indian Corn

  C:Traditional, from Willie O. Ault

  M:4/4

  L:1/8

  K:G

  N:From the playing of Rhys Jones and Cleek Shrey on Bigfoot String Band's album 

  N:'I've got a Bulldog'. Rhys Jones adds that "Indian Corn comes from the fiddling 

  N:of Willie O. Ault, from the small town of Hidalgo, Illinois. Willie was an old 

  N:fiddler that was 'collected' and field recorded by Garry Harrison back in the 

  N:1970s when Willie was in his 80s. My mentor Lynn 'Chirps' Smith was in an old time 

  N:stringband with Garry called The Indian Creek Delta Boys when they were in their 

  N:late teens and early twenties (they attended the same high school). When I was 

  N:learning tunes from Chirps as a teenager myself, I had access to those field 

  N:recordings including the ones of Willie Ault. The tape was mislabeled with 

  N:Indian Corn listed as Ol’ Woodward’s Tune and for years everyone mistakenly 

  N:called Indian Corn by that name.

  N:If you are interested in the source recording, I think it might be included 

  N:in Garry’s project 'Dear Old Illinois' which was a book with accompanying CD he 

  N:put out shortly before his death. The book is mostly tune transcriptions with the 

  N:CD being accompanying field recordings".
