# Bob Buckley's tunebook code
The code in this folder/directory creates HTML tunebooks from an ABC notation file and a few template files.

You also need a running version of abcm2ps and the means to run it all from a UNIX/Linux style shell. The command is runtunes-oldtime.sh It expects the ABC file as it's argument.
